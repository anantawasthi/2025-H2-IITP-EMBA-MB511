In Python, **libraries** are collections of pre-written code (modules and packages) that provide reusable functions, classes, and tools for performing specific tasks. Instead of writing everything from scratch, programmers can import these libraries to quickly add powerful functionality to their programs.

### Why programmers use libraries:

1. **Saves time and effort** – Common tasks like math calculations, data analysis, or web requests don’t need to be re-coded.

2. **Reliability** – Libraries are usually written, tested, and maintained by experts or large communities, so they are less error-prone.

3. **Readability** – Using libraries makes code shorter and easier to understand.

4. **Specialized functionality** – Some libraries provide domain-specific tools (e.g., `pandas` for data analysis, `TensorFlow` for machine learning).

5. **Ecosystem growth** – Python has thousands of libraries, which makes it versatile for fields like web development, AI, data science, and more.

## Example:

```python
import math

# Using the math library to calculate square root
result = math.sqrt(25)
print(result)   # Output: 5.0
```

Here, instead of coding the square root formula yourself, you just use Python’s built-in `math` library.
